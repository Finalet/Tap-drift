If you are looking for the original Roller Coaster scene from this video: https://youtu.be/OGepHiPnUKc You can find it on out GitHub repository: https://github.com/Dreamteck/dreamteck-splines

The reason for excluding it from the package is that it used a lot of assets and animations as well as a vertex colored shader that doesn't work with all versions of Unity. Ensuring that this scene works for each version of Unity was taking a lot of time.
